        <h4>SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) Vaccination Model, with Vital Dynamics.</h4>
        <p> Using standard mathematical modeling principles, I created a project that shows the steady-state<br>
          for an infection that is introduced, with and without the presence of vaccines. By making educated assumptions, <br>
          creating appropriate variables and constants, performing a dimension check and non-parameterization, I was able to determine the <br>
          corresponding eigenvalues that were necessary in solving for the steady-state circumstances. </p>
        <p>Below is a presentation I gave on the computation and subject.</p>
