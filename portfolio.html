          <h4>SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) Vaccination Model, with Vital Dynamics.</h4>
          <p> Using standard mathematical modeling principles, I created a project that shows the steady-state<br>
            for an infection that is introduced, with and without the presence of vaccines. By making educated assumptions, <br>
            creating appropriate variables and constants, performing a dimension check and non-parameterization, I was able to determine the <br>
            corresponding eigenvalues that were necessary in solving for the steady-state circumstances. </p>
          <p>Below is a presentation and in depth report I prepared on the computation and subject.</p>

          <h4>Timeline of Mathematics Education</h4>
          <p>In a linear fashion, I put together trends, laws, movements, and big waves in <br>
          mathematics education throughout history in the United States.</p>

          <h4>Curriculum Design for MTH 3001 - Complete History of Mathematics</h4>
          <p> Proposed upper -level mathematics course for University of Cincinnati. This course covers ancient Babylonian
          and Greek mathematics through 19th century mathematics.</p>
          <p>Below are the prepared lectures, slide shows, tests, etc. for the entirety of the course.</p>
