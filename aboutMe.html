        <h2>Kaesi Rene Luck: August 15, 1995 - present </h2>
        <h3> Early Life </h3>
        <p> I was born and raised in Lincoln City, Oregon. A small town on the central coast of Oregon, there resides around 7,000 
          individuals. With forest nestled all the way up to the beautiful sandy coast, I was spoiled on nature. I technical grew up about
          15 minutes outside of town, in an even smaller area, Otis. I had the joy of growing up on the Salmon River. I spent the first 18 years
          of my life surrounded with the most amazing forces of nature. My heart belongs to the Salmon River and Pacific Ocean.</p>
        <p> I am the second oldest of 7 siblings. Kaela, Kaesi, Matthew, Madison, Skye, Tye, Kai. I have spent my whole life working on staying
          very close with some of my siblings, we gave ourselves the name, "The Originals". Kaela, Kaesi, Matthew, Madison. Growing up,
          a lot of the time, we were all each other had. We were each others parents, heroes, best-friends, inspirations, we learned vicariously
          through one another, and taught each other everything we could. Us four have gone through the ringer together, from divorces to 
          infidelity to moving across the country. We have stayed together. We fight hard to not let the strains of growing up, the distance that comes
          naturally in adulthood, come between us. I recently moved back home (to Portland) after 3 years away in Cincinnati, OH. I am proud to say I currently live with Madison, 
          Kaela lives a 15 minute walk away, and Matthew although lives in another city currently, stays close with us as well. 
          My family, and especially "The Originals" are the most important part of everyday, and we know that we will never let our relationships drift apart. </p>

        <h2> My Passions </h2>
        <h3> Mathematics </h3>
        <p> I did not realize my passion for mathematics until I started college-level courses. As a junior in high school, I had the opportunity
          to take college level Algebra and Trigonometry. I quickly realized how naturally the language of mathematics came to me. I understood the language,
          so anxiety inducing to most, fluently flowed from the tip of my pen. I immediately submersed myself in the field. I became a private tutor, 
          I ended up teaching summer school that same year, and the year following, I taught freshman mathematics to students who were under-prepared
          for Algebra 1. In my senior year of high school, I took on College Calculus 1-3. I knew I would study mathematics for the remainder of my school career.</p>
        <p> I continued my passion for mathematics all through college. I got my Bachelor's of Science in Pure Mathematics from the 
          University of Cincinnati. During my schooling, I fell in love with abstract mathematics; I enjoyed math even through my computational
          years, and when I approached theoretical/abstract years, I fell deeper. Theoretical/Abstract mathematics exists usually with an absence of numbers.
          It consists of using logic and definitions to draft mathematical proofs. Mathematical proofs, as tedious, finicky and demanding as they are,
          they are where my love in mathematics lies. During my time in school, I opted for taking Computer Science as my science courses, and this 
          is when I found an entirely new passion.</p>
        <h3> Software Development </h3>
        <p> While studying mathematics in school, I found myself taking Computer Science courses. I went in blind. I had never known anything regarding
          programming other than some CSS I would use when editing my old "MySpace" page... As I dove deeper into the field of Computer Science I grew to love
          the discipline as much as I loved my mathematics. Computer Science, to me, was the marriage of two of the things I love most: mathematical proofs and 
          design. Writing a program, whether front or back-end, is almost identical to writing a mathematical proof. The major difference being, as you write
          your program, you are able to check your prcoess, you are able to see results along the way, and in the end, you (most of the time) produce lovely results.
          Which brings me to the second aspect I love most: deisgn. Specifically with Front-End Development, I am able to couple my mathematical skills
          with my natural eye for deisgn.
        </p>
        <h3> Design </h3>
        <p> I am not certified, nor educated, nor commissioned for or in design, but I have always had a passion for it. I attribute a little to my 
          knowledge of mathematics, with a keen eye for angles, spatial awareness, and attention to detail; and a lot to the obscure, out-of-the-box clothing, architecture, 
          interior design companies I keep up with. Whether it is in my home, or what I wear to work, I enjoy choosing exploring color palettes and mixes 
          of patterns and textures. Particularly in my home; no matter the square footage, amount of natural light, nice fixtures (or lack-there-of)
          I work hard to make every space the nicest it can possibly be. Through placement of: furntiure, colors, materials, plants placed at particular
          angles to optimize space and make sense functionally. This has been a passion of mine for years, and I cannot wait to see where it will take me some day.
        </p>
        <h3> Plants </h3>
        <p> This is my newest hobby. I always considered myself a person that cannot take care of plants. Every plant I had tried to love
        would very quickly die. That was until I got myself a Monstera Deliciosa when living in Cincinnati, OH. When I moved back home I had
        to leave the plant behind, it had gotten so big that there was no way I could fit it in my car. I was damn proud of that plant.
        Once getting back home, I knew I could settle in, in a way I couldn't have in Cincinnati, so I took to purchasing another haul of plants.
        Then one day, sitting in a plant shop for only $25, was a small, baby Monstera. Most people want to purchase these tropical plants 
        when they are more grown, so they can be used as a piece of decor, essentially. So this healthy little Monstera was quite the steal.
        I am happy to report that she is not twice the size and thriving compared to her condition but 5 months ago.</p>
        <p> My current plant collection consists of: 2 unknown cacti, an unknown leafy plant, a palm plant, wizard rose (plus one propagating), moss terrarium, monstera deliciosa (plus one propagating), calathea medallion,
          rhipsalis baccifera, pilea peperomiode (plus three propagating), fiddle leaf fig tree, variegated rubber tree, angel-wing begonia (plus two propagating), 
          peperomia 'raspberry ice', peperomia nummulariifolia, peperomia - generic, philodendron - imperial red. And counting....</p>

        <h2> The Future </h2>
        <h3> Home and Career </h3>
        <p>Within the near future, I would love to buy a home. I want to own a little piece of this state of Oregon, the place I have called 
          home for all of my life. Something small in the little communicty of St. Johns is my ideal.</p>
         <p>I truly hope to get a career I love that does not feel so much like work. Something that falls into any or all of the passions above would be most idyllic.
          I have sincerely worked hard for years, I have never taken the easy way, and I hope someday to channel that energy into 
          a company that is deserving of dedicated, hard-working people. I dream of finding a career and company that make the world a little better. </p>
