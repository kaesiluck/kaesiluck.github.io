        <h2>Kaesi Rene Luck: August 15, 1995 - present </h2>
        <h3> Early Life </h3>
        <p> I was born and raised in Lincoln City, Oregon. A small town on the central coast of Oregon, there resides around 7,000 
          individuals. With forest nestled all the way up to the beautiful sandy coast, I was spoiled on nature. I technical grew up about
          15 minutes outside of town, in an even smaller area, Otis. I had the joy of growing up on the Salmon River. I spent the first 18 years
          of my life surrounded with the most amazing forces of nature. My heart belongs to the Salmon River and Pacific Ocean.</p>
        <p> I am the second oldest of 7 siblings. Kaela, Kaesi, Matthew, Madison, Skye, Tye, Kai. I have spent my whole life working on staying
          very close with some of my siblings, we gave ourselves the name, "The Originals". Kaela, Kaesi, Matthew, Madison. Growing up,
          a lot of the time, we were all each other had. We were each others parents, heroes, best-friends, inspirations, we learned vicariously
          through one another, and taught each other everything we could. Us four have gone through the ringer together, from divorces to 
          infidelity to moving across the country. We have stayed together. We fight hard to not let the strains of growing up, the distance that comes
          naturally in adulthood, come between us. I recently moved back home (to Portland) after 3 years away in Cincinnati, OH. I am proud to say I currently live with Madison, 
          Kaela lives a 15 minute walk away, and Matthew although lives in another city currently, stays close with us as well. 
          My family, and especially "The Originals" are the most important part of everyday, and we know that we will never let our relationships drift apart. </p>

        <h2> My Passions </h2>
        <h3> Mathematics </h3>
        <p> I did not realize my passion for mathematics until I started college-level courses. As a junior in high school, I had the opportunity
          to take college level Algebra and Trigonometry. I quickly realized how naturally the language of mathematics came to me. I understood the language,
          so anxiety inducing to most, fluently flowed from the tip of my pen. I immediately submersed myself in the field. I became a private tutor, 
          I ended up teaching summer school that same year, and the year following, I taught freshman mathematics to students who were under-prepared
          for Algebra 1. In my senior year of high school, I took on College Calculus 1-3. I knew I would study mathematics for the remainder of my school career.</p>
