       <h2>CDK Global</h2>
       <h3>September 2019 - current</h3>
       <p>Skills acquired and responsibilities in the role: Familiarizing myself with the B2B business model,
         working closely with clients to determine issues within the proprietary software and troubleshooting/researching to fix said issues.
         This position has taught me how to communicate technical matters with non-technical individuals, how to think quickly and on my feet, how to
         absorb the frustrations of clients through compassion and empathy. I have become comfortable working in a software environment and I have learned 
         the extent and the process for producing quality products to meet client needs.</p>

        <h2>Queen City Whip</h2>
       <h3>June 2018 - September 2019</h3>
       <p>Skills acquired and responsibilities in the role: If nothing else, this role taught me the value of teamwork and positivity.
        This food truck resides in Cincinnati, OH, and for those that have never been, facing the weather in an outdoor position year-round is no easy feat.
        I managed a team through 120 degree humid summer days, 0 degree cold winter days, through thick and thin. This role taught me that as a member of a team
        I naturally fall into a leadership role. I worked hard everyday to bring positivity and excitement to dreadful work conditions. I quickly 
        worked my way to General Manager at this company and I happily took on the stress of the team. I was there to make their lives easier and to take 
        the hardest tasks, in the dog days of summer, off of the team and put them onto myself to create a more peaceful environment to work in.</p>

        <h2>Landlocked Social House</h2>
       <h3>August 2017 - June 2018</h3>
       <p>Skills acquired and responsibilities in the role: This role has taught me how important the smallest detail can be. 
        As consumers, we typically leave our local coffee shop with latte in hand, head down, focusing on our lives we do not stop
        to think of the maticulous detail put into every cup. Here, I was a barista, learning the finicky and lovely nature of pulling
        top quality espresso and steaming velvety sweet milk. This job taught me the amount of work put into opening a small business,
        the role that the farmers play in harvesting coffee beans, and the control of multiple variable needed to produce high quality coffee.
        I learned that temperature, time, extraction, weight, volume, angles, humidity, roast, etc. all play key parts in that morning latte
        most of us take advantage of. This job taught me to appreciate the smallest of things. </p>
